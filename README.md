# Power-BI-Employee-Sight-Dashboard
I built an Employee Sight Dashboard to analyze HR and salary data. It covers 145 employees across 14 roles, with Manufacturing having the most staff. Senior Associates pay the highest average tax, and the top earner gets ₹9.26M. HR has only one employee. Most hires were in 2006–2007. The dashboard aids in salary planning and staffing decisions.
